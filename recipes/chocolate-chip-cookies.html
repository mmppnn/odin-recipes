        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>These are truly the <em>best</em> soft & chewy Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong>  you will ever make. They taste just like the ones you would buy at a bakery so no one will know they are secretly eggless & dairy-free!</p>
        <p>A few months ago I made the best Vegan Oatmeal Cream Pies. In fact, when serving it to my friends (who taste test all my recipes) they said they were the best thing I've ever made.</p>
        <p>This oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe is adapted straight from that recipe. It has the same amazing flavor but is a little less soft, a little chewier, & filled with a whole lot of chocolatey goodness!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup vegan butter <em>room temperature</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cane sugar</li>
            <li>1 flax egg (1 Tablespoon/8 grams ground flaxseed mixed with 3 Tablespoons water, left to sit 5 minutes)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt *add up to 1/2 teaspoon if using unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Before making the cooke dough, make the flax egg by mixing the ground flaxseed and water in a small bowl and setting aside for later.</li>
            <li>To make the dough, add the room temperature vegan butter, brown sugar, and white cane sugar to a mixing bowl. Then, use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar together until fluffy (about 1 minute).</li>
            <li>Next, add in the flax egg and vanilla bean paste and mix together for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the all-purpose flour, rolled oats, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt to the mixing bowl. Make sure to add the flour first and then add the other ingredients on top. Then, mix everything together using an electric mixer until a thick cookie dough forms.</li>
            <li>Add 6 Tablespoons (60 grams) of the chocolate chips to the cookie dough and use a spatula or spoon to fold them into the dough. Then, cover the bowl of cookie dough with plastic wrap and add it to the fridge to chill for 30 minutes- 1 hour. The dough can also be refrigerated up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>About 10 minutes before removing the dough from the fridge preheat the oven to 350F and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Use a large cookie scoop (3 Tablespoons) to scoop out 10 evenly sized cookies and place them onto the baking sheet. Make sure to space the cookies at least 2 inches apart on the tray and do not flatten them as they will spread while baking. All of the cookies will not fit on one baking sheet, so I recommend baking 5-6 cookies at a time on one tray vs. putting two trays in the oven at the same time.</li>
            <li>Before baking the cookies, take the additional 2 Tablespoons of chocolate chips and add them on top of the cookie dough balls.</li>
            <li>Then, add to the tray of cookies to the oven to bake for 13-15 minutes. If making smaller cookies (about 1.5 Tablespoon cookie scoop) reduce the baking time to 10-12 minutes.  The cookies will continue baking after they are removed from the oven so the centers should still be soft, but not glossy or raw, when they are removed from the oven.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookie tray from the oven and immediately tap the tray on the counter to produce a more “wrinkly” cookie and help deflate the cookies. The cookies will still be very thick, but this makes them slightly chewier. For round cookies, use a round cookie cutter (or large mug in my case!) that is slightly larger than the cookie and swirl the cookies around inside to form them into a round cookie. This step will only work if you do it while the cookies are still warm.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies cool on the baking tray for about 5 minutes. Then, move to a wire rack to continue cooling. Once cooled, serve & enjoy!</li>
