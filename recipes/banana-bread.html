            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Vegan baking can be a little bit like Goldilocks in the classic fairy tale. Home cooks can find one recipe to be too dry, the next too moist; another one can be too sweet, but the next is not sweet enough. Happy ending alert: This vegan banana nut bread recipe is “just right” in every way.</p>
